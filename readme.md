# PORTFOLIO
Here are some of the projects I worked on the past. 

# [Project 1: South Bend temperature predictions](https://github.com/oceancode1997/southbendtemperature)
Analyze what environment factors are best to be used as predictors for temperature in South Bend area.  <br />
Create a tool to predict the average temperature in the area using significant environment factors (MSE = 6.15)  <br />

# [Project 2: S&P 500 time series analysis](https://github.com/oceancode1997/SP500priceprediction)
Comparing different time series model to find the best model that can predict the log return of SP 500. <br />
The best model has forecast MSE of 0.0144 and accurately predicts the log return of S&P in 2 year	period within 2%. <br />

# [Project 3: Simulation study: what criterion is best for linear model selection](https://github.com/oceancode1997/Stimulation-study-what-criterion-is-best-for-linear-model)
Use simulation to find among popular criterion for model selection: AIC, BIC, Radjusted, PRESS, Mallow Cp. what is the best criterion to use when performing linear model selection <br />
Found that BIC outperforms other criterion is various settings. <br />
